                alt="Chess">
            <p class="description-game">Chess is one of the oldest and most popular strategy games in the world, with origins dating back over 1,500
                years to ancient India. The game is played on an 8x8 board with 16 pieces per player, including a king,
                queen, rooks, knights, bishops, and pawns. The objective is to checkmate the opponent's king, meaning it is
                in a position where it cannot escape capture. The longest chess game theoretically possible is 5,949 moves.
                The world‚Äôs first official chess tournament was held in 1851 in London, and since then, the game has evolved
                with the introduction of chess clocks and computer analysis. The first World Chess Champion, Wilhelm
                Steinitz, was crowned in 1886. The game has many variations, including blitz, rapid, and bullet chess, each
                requiring different levels of speed and strategy. Notably, **Magnus Carlsen** is the reigning World Chess
                Champion, and computers like **Deep Blue** and **AlphaZero** have made significant impacts on chess,
                defeating human champions. Chess is also recognized for its cognitive benefits, including improving memory,
                problem-solving skills, and concentration.</p>

                alt="Cards">
            <p class="description-game">Playing cards have a rich history, originating in China during the Tang Dynasty before spreading to Europe
                and the Middle East. A standard deck contains 52 cards, divided into four suits‚Äîhearts, diamonds, clubs, and
                spades‚Äîeach with 13 ranks, and often includes a joker, introduced in the 19th century. The four suits are
                thought to symbolize different aspects of life: love, wealth, growth, and war. Playing cards are used in
                thousands of games worldwide, including popular ones like **Poker**, **Bridge**, and **Solitaire**, and have
                also become central to magic tricks. The number 52 is said to correspond to the 52 weeks of the year, with
                the four suits representing the four seasons. Over time, custom decks have emerged, reflecting local culture
                and themes, and collecting rare playing cards has grown into a popular hobby.</p>
